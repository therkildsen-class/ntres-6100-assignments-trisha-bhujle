Assignment 8: My assignment has been uploaded to the problem_sets folder in my course repo, but I was very stuck on 2.4. I spent a few hours trying to troubleshoot it and think my code is close but not fully thereâ€”I think something is wrong with my mutate code and with my ggplot code, but I'm not sure what! (I was also unsure whether to use ggsave or plot directly onto the assignment, but regardless, I don't think my plots are correct.) 

Assignment 9: My assignment has been uploaded to the problem_sets folder in my course repo!
